# Simon Says Game

## Overview
The **Simon Says Game** is a simple memory-based game where the player observes a sequence of flashing colors and reproduces the sequence by clicking the corresponding buttons. The game gets progressively more challenging as the sequence length increases.

## Features
- Responsive design to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- "Tap Anywhere" functionality to start the game on mobile.
- Dynamic highest score tracking.
- Intuitive interface with color buttons that flash to indicate the sequence.

## Instructions
1. Observe the sequence of flashing colors.
2. Click the buttons in the same order as they flashed.
3. If the sequence is correct, a new color is added to the sequence, and the game continues.
4. If the sequence is incorrect, the game ends, and your score is displayed.
5. Start a new game by tapping anywhere (on mobile) or pressing any key (on desktop).
